# Medical Imaging Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated the AI Medical Imaging Agent from `ai_medical_imaging_agent` into the `health_crew` project. The system now features complete medical imaging analysis capabilities alongside the existing multi-agent diagnosis workflow.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Files Created
- **`health_crew/imaging_tools.py`** - Medical imaging analysis tools using Gemini Vision
  - `medical_image_analysis()` - Analyzes medical images (X-ray, MRI, CT, etc.)
  - `extract_imaging_findings()` - Extracts and summarizes imaging findings
  - `compare_imaging_timeline()` - Compares current and previous images for progression tracking

### 2. Modified Files

#### `health_crew/agents.py`
- Added `imaging_analyst` agent with medical imaging tools
- Configured as a board-certified radiologist with expertise in interpreting medical images

#### `health_crew/tasks.py`
- Added `imaging_analysis_task` for processing uploaded medical images
- Task integrates imaging findings with patient symptoms and history

#### `health_crew/workflows.py`
- Updated `build_diagnosis_crew()` to accept `include_imaging` parameter
- Imaging agent runs early in the workflow (after symptom analysis) to provide context

#### `streamlit_app.py` (Complete Rewrite)
- **Two-column layout**: Patient information form + medical image upload
- **Image upload support**: JPG, JPEG, PNG, DICOM formats
- **Real-time preview**: Shows uploaded images before analysis
- **API key validation**: Checks both OpenAI and Google AI keys
- **Enhanced results display**: Tabbed interface with full report and raw output
- **Professional styling**: Wide layout, icons, color-coded status indicators
- **Temp file management**: Automatically saves and cleans up uploaded images

#### `requirements.txt`
- Added `streamlit>=1.30.0` for web UI
- Added `Pillow>=10.0.0` for image processing

#### `.gitignore`
- Added `temp_uploads/` directory
- Added medical image file extensions (*.png, *.jpg, *.jpeg, *.dicom)

#### `.env.example`
- Reorganized with clear REQUIRED vs OPTIONAL sections
- Added Google AI API key documentation and links
- Added tracing flag for debugging

#### `README.md`
- Added "Medical Imaging Analysis" section with capabilities and usage
- Updated feature list to highlight imaging analysis
- Expanded quickstart guide with web UI instructions
- Enhanced environment variables documentation

## Features Integrated

### Medical Imaging Capabilities
1. **Automatic Modality Detection**
   - Identifies X-ray, MRI, CT, ultrasound, etc.
   - Recognizes anatomical regions and positioning

2. **Comprehensive Analysis**
   - Key findings and abnormalities detection
   - Severity assessment (Normal/Mild/Moderate/Severe)
   - Diagnostic assessment with confidence levels
   - Patient-friendly explanations

3. **Integration with Diagnosis Workflow**
   - Imaging findings influence symptom analysis
   - Results integrated into treatment recommendations
   - Supports emergency flag detection

4. **Timeline Comparison**
   - Compare current and previous images
   - Track disease progression or treatment response

### Web UI Features
- Clean, professional medical interface
- Side-by-side patient info and imaging upload
- Real-time multi-agent processing with progress indicators
- Comprehensive diagnosis reports with tabbed views
- API key validation and status display
- Responsive layout with proper spacing and styling

## Technical Architecture

### Agent Flow (with Imaging)
```
1. Symptom Analyzer → Initial assessment
2. Imaging Analyst → Medical image interpretation (if provided)
3. History Reviewer → Medical history analysis
4. Treatment Agent → Evidence-based recommendations
5. Referral Agent → Specialist coordination
6. Interaction Checker → Drug safety validation
7. Scheduler Agent → Follow-up planning
8. Communication Agent → Patient-facing guidance
```

### API Requirements
- **OpenAI API** (required) - Powers LLM agents for text analysis
- **Google AI API** (required) - Powers Gemini Vision for image analysis

## Usage Instructions

### Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure API keys in .env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_ai_key
```

### Run Web UI
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

### Using Medical Imaging
1. Fill in patient information (symptoms, demographics, history)
2. Upload a medical image (X-ray, MRI, CT scan, etc.)
3. Click "Run Diagnosis"
4. System will automatically:
   - Analyze the image with Gemini Vision
   - Integrate findings with patient data
   - Generate comprehensive diagnosis report

### Without Imaging
Simply omit the image upload - the system runs the standard 7-agent workflow without the imaging analyst.

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test without imaging**
   - Verify standard 7-agent workflow functions
   - Check OpenAI API integration

2. **Test with imaging**
   - Upload various medical image types
   - Verify Gemini Vision analysis quality
   - Check integration with diagnosis workflow

3. **Test API key validation**
   - Run without keys (should show warnings)
   - Run with only OpenAI key (imaging disabled)
   - Run with both keys (full functionality)

4. **Test UI responsiveness**
   - Different screen sizes
   - Long-running diagnosis (progress indicators)
   - Error handling (invalid images, API failures)

## Future Enhancements
- Support for DICOM file parsing and metadata extraction
- Multi-image upload for comparison views
- Image annotation and markup tools
- Integration with PACS systems
- Automated reporting in standard radiology formats
- Voice dictation for radiologist input

## Compliance Notes
- All imaging analysis includes disclaimer for physician review
- Emergency findings trigger alert system
- Audit logging captures all imaging interpretations
- HIPAA considerations for temp file cleanup

## Status
✅ **Integration Complete** - All features from ai_medical_imaging_agent successfully integrated into health_crew with enhanced multi-agent workflow capabilities.
